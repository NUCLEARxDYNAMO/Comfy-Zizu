## 🖌️ Customization

---

Remove the main suffix from the downloaded folder, and use

> ./spicetify config current_theme Comfy-Zizu
> ./spicetify apply

Voila, you're theme is now applied!

Second, change overwite_assets value to 1 in your config-xpui.ini.

For later customization and tweaks of your own, feel free to pole around!

Go into your theme folder and open either :

`color.ini` for the colors

`user.css` and scroll to the bottom to modify the code
