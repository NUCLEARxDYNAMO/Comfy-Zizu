## 🖌️ Customization

### Installation Method-1

Use (https://github.com/ShaunakPemmaraju/Comfy-Zizu/blob/main/spicetify-theme-installer.py) to install the theme directly with no hassle.
  Requires python3.

### Installation Method-2
Remove the "main" suffix from the downloaded folder, and use

> ./spicetify config current_theme Comfy-Zizu

> ./spicetify apply

Voila, your theme is now applied!

Second, change overwite_assets value to 1 in your config-xpui.ini.

For later customization and tweaks of your own, feel free to poke around!

Go into your theme folder and open either :

`color.ini` for the colors

`user.css` and scroll to the bottom to modify the code
